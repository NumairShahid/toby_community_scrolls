# Stillness In The Pond

## EN
The pond does not rush to reflect the moon.  
It waits in perfect stillness until the light arrives on its own.

So too the faithful — no noise, no force.  
Only quiet presence, day after day.

Distribution remembers those who hold the water steady.  
One ripple at a time, the crown forms unseen.
